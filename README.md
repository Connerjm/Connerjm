# Hi there <!-- THIS TOO BIG ![A waving hand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif) -->

This is something I discovered recently and am still playing around with so it will be under construction for a while.

My name is Conner, and I am currently enrolled in a full-stack boot camp hosted through the University of Washington and Trilogy. Here on my GitHub you can see all of my projects I've completed for that boot camp. I graduated from UW with a Bachelors's degree in Computer Science and Systems a few years back, so I have a strong OOP foundation as most of the classes were structured around Java. As such, my HTML and CSS are still a bit lacking so I try to practice those languages whenever I have the opportunity.
